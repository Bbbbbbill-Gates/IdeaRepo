# ALL THIS IS ABOUT PROFESSIONAL PLAYER OR PRE-PROFESSIONAL PLAYER

## The first idea
Create a meachine learning model which is to train as a Analyzer that is going to work out the connection between young football player's performance and the probability of being a outstanding core player in any team chosen.

Because we always demonstrate whether a player is successful by judging if he/she is the core player of a high level team or team in the high level league. So this model is about performance in the others' environment to help us understand would a player figure out the situation or not.

## The second idea
This is going to find out the physical ability and mental ability with which a young football player can improve. The aim of this meachine learning model is going to help young player to be illustrious in the peer competition.
